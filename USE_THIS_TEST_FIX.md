# 🎯 "Use This Test" Button Flow Fixed

## Problem
When users clicked "Use This Test" from Test Advisor recommendations, they were taken back to the file upload screen instead of directly to the analysis with their already-uploaded file.

## Root Cause
The `handleSelectTest` function in App.tsx was:
1. Setting the analysis type ✅
2. Pre-filling options ✅
3. Exiting Test Advisor mode ✅
4. **But NOT passing the uploaded file** ❌

The file was `null` because Test Advisor mode clears it on entry, and it wasn't being restored when selecting a test.

## Solution

### 1. Updated TestAdvisor Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/TestAdvisor.tsx`

**Changed interface:**
```typescript
// Before
interface TestAdvisorProps {
  onSelectTest: (testInfo: TestRecommendation) => void;
}

// After
interface TestAdvisorProps {
  onSelectTest: (testInfo: TestRecommendation, file: File | null) => void;
}
```

**Updated button click:**
```typescript
// Before
onClick={() => onSelectTest(test)}

// After
onClick={() => onSelectTest(test, uploadedFile)}
```

### 2. Updated App Component
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

**Updated handler:**
```typescript
// Before
const handleSelectTest = (testInfo: any) => {
  setAnalysisType(testInfo.analysis_type);
  if (testInfo.gradstat_options) {
    setOptions(testInfo.gradstat_options);
  }
  setShowTestAdvisor(false);
  setError(null);
};

// After
const handleSelectTest = (testInfo: any, uploadedFile: File | null) => {
  setAnalysisType(testInfo.analysis_type);
  if (testInfo.gradstat_options) {
    setOptions(testInfo.gradstat_options);
  }
  
  // Set the uploaded file from Test Advisor
  if (uploadedFile) {
    setFile(uploadedFile);
  }
  
  setShowTestAdvisor(false);
  setError(null);
};
```

## User Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User uploads file in Test Advisor ✅
2. User answers questions ✅
3. User gets recommendations ✅
4. User clicks "Use This Test" ❌
5. **Redirected to file upload screen** ❌
6. User has to upload file again ❌

### After Fix:
1. User uploads file in Test Advisor ✅
2. User answers questions ✅
3. User gets recommendations ✅
4. User clicks "Use This Test" ✅
5. **Directly goes to analysis interface** ✅
6. **File is already loaded** ✅
7. **Options are pre-filled** ✅
8. User can immediately run analysis! 🎉

## Testing Instructions

1. Go to Test Advisor mode
2. Upload `test-data/survival-data.csv`
3. Select "Compare groups"
4. Answer questions (or use pre-filled)
5. Get recommendations
6. Click "Use This Test →" on any recommendation
7. **Verify:** Should go directly to analysis interface
8. **Verify:** File name should appear (not "No file selected")
9. **Verify:** Analysis type should be set correctly
10. **Verify:** Options should be pre-filled
11. **Verify:** Can click "Run Analysis" immediately

## Impact
- ✅ Smoother user experience
- ✅ No need to re-upload file
- ✅ Faster workflow from recommendation to analysis
- ✅ Maintains all pre-filled options
- ✅ One-click from recommendation to ready-to-run analysis
