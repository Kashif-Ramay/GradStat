# âœ… Rate Limit Fixed - Error 429 Resolved

## ðŸš« What Was the Problem?

**Error 429: Too Many Requests**

The backend had a rate limiter set to:
- **100 requests per 15 minutes**

During testing, clicking the Test Advisor multiple times quickly exceeded this limit.

---

## âœ… What I Fixed

Changed rate limit to be more permissive for development:

**Before:**
```javascript
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
max: 100,                   // 100 requests
```

**After:**
```javascript
windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000,   // 1 minute
max: 1000,                  // 1000 requests
```

**New limit:** 1000 requests per minute (plenty for testing!)

## ðŸš€ Backend Restarted

âœ… Backend server restarted with new rate limit  
âœ… Running on port 3001  
âœ… Ready to accept requests

## ðŸŽ¯ Try It Now!

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Click **"ðŸ§­ Test Advisor"**
3. Click **"Compare groups"**
4. Answer questions
5. Click **"Get Recommendations"**

**You can now click as many times as you want without hitting the rate limit!**

## ðŸ“Š Current Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Window | Max Requests |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| All `/api/*` | 1 minute | 1000 |

This is **perfect for development and testing**.

For production, you might want to reduce it back to something like:
- 100 requests per minute
- Or 500 requests per 5 minutes

## ðŸŽ‰ Test Advisor Should Work Now!

The rate limit was the only issue. Everything else is working:
- âœ… Worker server running
- âœ… Backend server running (with new rate limit)
- âœ… Endpoints responding correctly
- âœ… Frontend connected

**Go ahead and test it!** ðŸš€
