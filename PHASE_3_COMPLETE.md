# 🎉 Phase 3 Complete - Enhanced User Guidance!

> **AssumptionChecker, BestPractices, and CommonMistakes components successfully implemented**

---

## ✅ What We Built

### 1. AssumptionChecker Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/AssumptionChecker.tsx` (~200 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Visual display of all assumption checks
- ✅ Color-coded status (green = passed, red = failed)
- ✅ Statistical details (p-values, test statistics)
- ✅ Remediation suggestions for violated assumptions
- ✅ Overall status summary
- ✅ Educational notes explaining why assumptions matter

**Remediation Suggestions for:**
- Normality violations → Non-parametric tests, transformations
- Homogeneity of variance → Welch's t-test, robust methods
- Independence → Mixed-effects models
- Linearity → Polynomial terms, non-linear models
- Homoscedasticity → Weighted least squares
- Multicollinearity → Remove predictors, PCA, regularization

**UI Design:**
- Green cards for passed assumptions ✓
- Red cards for violated assumptions ✗
- Expandable remediation boxes
- Statistical details in small text
- Educational note at bottom

---

### 2. BestPractices Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/BestPractices.tsx` (~350 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Analysis-specific do's and don'ts
- ✅ Pro tips for each analysis type
- ✅ Reporting guidelines with APA examples
- ✅ Expandable/collapsible panel
- ✅ Context-aware warnings based on results

**Coverage:**
- **t-tests**: Normality, equal variances, Cohen's d
- **ANOVA**: Post-hoc tests, eta-squared, multiple testing
- **Regression**: Multicollinearity, outliers, R², standardized coefficients
- **Correlation**: Linearity, causation vs correlation, outliers
- **Logistic Regression**: Odds ratios, AUC-ROC, class imbalance
- **Chi-square**: Expected frequencies, Fisher's exact, effect sizes
- **ANCOVA**: Homogeneity of slopes, covariate selection

**UI Sections:**
1. **Do's** (green) - Best practices to follow
2. **Don'ts** (red) - Common mistakes to avoid
3. **Pro Tips** (blue) - Advanced guidance
4. **Reporting Guidelines** (purple) - APA format examples

---

### 3. CommonMistakes Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/CommonMistakes.tsx` (~200 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Proactive warning system
- ✅ Three severity levels (error, warning, info)
- ✅ Context-aware detection
- ✅ Specific fix suggestions
- ✅ Data-driven warnings

**Detects:**
- **Sample Size Issues**: Too small (<10), small (<30)
- **Assumption Violations**: Normality, equal variances
- **Analysis-Specific Mistakes**:
  - t-test: Wrong test for non-normal data
  - ANOVA: Only 2 groups (should use t-test)
  - Regression: Too many predictors, outliers
  - Correlation: Outliers affecting results
  - Logistic: Small sample size
  - Chi-square: Low expected frequencies
- **Alpha Level Issues**: Unusual values (>0.10 or <0.001)
- **Multiple Testing**: Type I error inflation

**UI Design:**
- 🚫 Red for errors (critical issues)
- ⚠️ Yellow for warnings (caution needed)
- ℹ️ Blue for info (helpful tips)
- Fix suggestions in colored boxes

## 💡 Example User Experience

### Scenario: Student runs t-test with small sample (n=15)

**1. CommonMistakes Warning:**
```
⚠️ Small Sample Size
Your sample size (n=15) is small. Results may be less reliable.
💡 How to fix: Consider collecting more data or using 
non-parametric tests.
```

**2. InterpretationHelper:**
```
📊 Results Interpretation
The t-test showed a significant difference (p = .023).
However, with a small sample size, interpret cautiously.
Effect size (d = 0.65) suggests a medium practical effect.
```

**3. AssumptionChecker:**
```
✓ Normality: Passed (p = .156)
✓ Equal Variances: Passed (p = .234)
✅ All assumptions met. Results are reliable.
```

**4. BestPractices (expandable):**
```
✓ Do's:
- Report Cohen's d for effect size
- Use Welch's t-test if variances unequal
- Verify normality with Shapiro-Wilk test

✗ Don'ts:
- Don't use t-test with severely non-normal data
- Don't assume equal variances without testing

💡 Pro Tips:
- Sample size of 30+ helps with normality assumption
- Visualize data with box plots before testing

📝 Reporting:
Example: "t(28) = 3.45, p = .002, d = 0.92"
```
