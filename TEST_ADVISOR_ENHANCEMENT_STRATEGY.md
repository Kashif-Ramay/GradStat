        'interpretability': 0-100, # Ease of understanding
        'sample_size': 0-100,      # Adequate sample size
        'user_level': 0-100        # Matches user expertise
    }
    
    total_score = weighted_average(scores)
    return total_score, scores
```

**Display:**
```
✅ Pearson Correlation (Score: 92/100)
├─ Appropriateness: ████████████ 95/100
├─ Statistical Power: ████████░░░ 85/100
├─ Robustness: ███████████░ 90/100
├─ Interpretability: ████████████ 98/100

   - Linearity (scatter plots)
   - Outliers (Z-scores, IQR)
4. Rank tests by assumption satisfaction
5. Show warnings for violated assumptions
```

**Display:**
```
🎯 Recommended: Independent t-test (Score: 88/100)

Assumption Checks:
✅ Normality: PASSED (Shapiro-Wilk p=0.12)
✅ Equal Variance: PASSED (Levene's p=0.34)

📚 Why Pearson Correlation?

Your Research Question:
"Does study time relate to exam scores?"

Why Pearson?
✅ Both variables are continuous (hours, scores)
✅ You want to measure strength of relationship
✅ Data appears normally distributed
✅ Relationship looks linear (from scatter plot)

Why NOT Spearman?
• Your data is normal (Spearman is for non-normal)
• Linear relationship (Spearman is for monotonic)

Why NOT Regression?
• You want association, not prediction
• Regression is for "predicting Y from X"
• Correlation is for "how related are X and Y?"

Correlation measures HOW RELATED two variables are.
Regression PREDICTS one variable from another.

Your research question is: 'Does study time relate to 
exam scores?' - This is asking about relationship 
strength, not prediction.

If you wanted to PREDICT exam scores from study time, 
then regression would be better.

Would you like to see both analyses?"
