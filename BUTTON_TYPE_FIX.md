# ✅ Button Type Fix - All Buttons Now Work

## 🐛 The Issue:

Buttons were registering clicks (visible in console) but not enabling the "Get Recommendations" button.

**Root Cause:** Missing `type="button"` attribute on predictor selection buttons.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

Added `type="button"` to the predictor selection buttons:

```typescript
<button
  type="button"  // ✅ Added
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('Selected: One predictor');
    handleAnswer('nPredictors', 1);
  }}
>
  One
</button>
```

### **For "Both continuous":**
1. Click "Both continuous" ✅
2. Second question appears: "How many predictor variables?"
3. Click "One" or "Multiple" ✅
4. "Get Recommendations" button enables ✅
5. Click "Get Recommendations" ✅

### **For other options:**
