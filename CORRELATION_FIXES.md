# ✅ Correlation Analysis Fixes - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: P-value Display in Summary Results ✅

**Problem:**  
P-values in correlation results were showing as `0.0000` instead of scientific notation

**Root Cause:**  
The `Results.tsx` component wasn't displaying correlation-specific fields (correlation coefficient, method, CI, effect size, direction)

**Solution:**  
Added correlation-specific field rendering in `Results.tsx`:
- ✅ Correlation coefficient (r) with highlighting
- ✅ Correlation method (Pearson/Spearman/Kendall)
- ✅ 95% Confidence Interval
- ✅ Effect Size interpretation
- ✅ Direction (Positive/Negative)

**File Modified:**  
`frontend/src/components/Results.tsx` - Added 30 lines for correlation display

---

### Issue 2: Correlation Not in Test Advisor ✅

**Problem:**  
Correlation analysis was not included in the Test Advisor recommendations

**Solution:**  
Added three correlation test types to Test Library and updated Test Advisor logic

**Changes Made:**

#### 1. Added to Test Library (`test_library.py`):

**Pearson Correlation:**
```python
'pearson_correlation': {
    'test_name': 'Pearson Correlation',
    'analysis_type': 'correlation',
    'plain_english': 'Measure linear relationship between two variables',
    'when_to_use': [
        'Want to measure association (not prediction)',
        'Both variables are continuous',
        'Linear relationship expected',
        'Data is roughly normally distributed'
    ],
    'example': 'Measure relationship between study hours and exam scores',
    'sample_size_min': 30
}
```

**Spearman Correlation:**
```python
'spearman_correlation': {
    'test_name': 'Spearman Correlation',
    'analysis_type': 'correlation',
    'plain_english': 'Measure monotonic relationship (works with non-normal data)',
    'when_to_use': [
        'Data is NOT normally distributed',
        'Relationship is monotonic but not linear',
        'Or have ordinal data (rankings)'
    ],
    'example': 'Measure relationship between income rank and happiness rating',
    'sample_size_min': 20
}
```

**Kendall's Tau:**
```python
'kendall_correlation': {
    'test_name': 'Kendall\'s Tau',
    'analysis_type': 'correlation',
    'plain_english': 'Conservative measure for ordinal data or small samples',
    'when_to_use': [
        'Small sample size (n < 30)',
        'Ordinal data (rankings)',
        'Want more conservative estimate',
        'Many tied values in data'
    ],
    'example': 'Measure agreement between two judges\' rankings',
    'sample_size_min': 10
}
```

#### 2. Updated Test Advisor Logic (`test_advisor.py`):

**New Recommendation Logic:**
```python
# For continuous vs continuous relationships:
if is_normal:
    - Pearson Correlation (HIGH priority)
    - Spearman Correlation (MEDIUM priority)
else:
    - Spearman Correlation (HIGH priority)
    - Kendall's Tau (MEDIUM priority)
    - Pearson Correlation (LOW priority)

# Also offers regression for prediction
```

**Files Modified:**
- `worker/test_library.py` - Added 3 correlation test definitions (~60 lines)
- `worker/test_advisor.py` - Updated relationship recommendation logic (~15 lines)

**Recommendations:**
1. ⭐⭐⭐ **Pearson Correlation** (HIGH)
2. ⭐⭐ **Spearman Correlation** (MEDIUM)
3. ⭐⭐⭐ **Simple Linear Regression** (HIGH)

---

### Scenario 2: Non-Normal Data, Want Association
**User Input:**
- Research Question: "Find relationships"
- Variable 1: Continuous
- Variable 2: Continuous
- Data is normal: No

**Recommendations:**
1. ⭐⭐⭐ **Spearman Correlation** (HIGH)
2. ⭐⭐ **Kendall's Tau** (MEDIUM)
3. ⭐ **Pearson Correlation** (LOW)
4. ⭐⭐⭐ **Simple Linear Regression** (HIGH)

---

### Scenario 3: Small Sample
**User Input:**
- Research Question: "Find relationships"
- Variable 1: Continuous
- Variable 2: Continuous
- Sample size: < 30

**Recommendations:**
