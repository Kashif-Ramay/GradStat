## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Restart Services

```bash
# Worker (if not already running)
cd worker
python main.py

# Frontend (restart to pick up changes)
# Ctrl+C in frontend terminal, then:
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Survival Analysis

1. Upload `test-data/survival-data.csv`
2. Select "Survival/time-to-event"
3. **Verify Summary Panel:**

   - 📊 Detected event column: 'event_occurred' (33.3% censored)
   - 👥 Found groups in 'treatment'
   - 📈 Found 2 covariate(s)
4. Click "Review Answers Manually"
5. **Verify Wizard:**
   - "Do you want to compare groups?" - YES pre-selected with ✨
   - "Do you have covariates?" - YES pre-selected with ✨
   - Both have confidence badges

### Step 3: Test PCA
