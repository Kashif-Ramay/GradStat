## 🎨 What Users Will See

### Step 1: File Upload Prompt
```
💡 Pro Tip: Upload Your Data First!

Upload your data file now, and we can automatically 
answer questions for you as you go through the wizard. ✨

[Choose File Button]
```

### After Upload:
```
✅ Data File Uploaded!
your-data.csv - Auto-detection enabled
[Change File]
```

### On Questions:
```
Is your data normally distributed?
○ Yes - Bell-shaped curve
○ No - Skewed or has outliers

✨ I'm not sure - Test it for me
```

### While Detecting:
```
⏳ Analyzing your data...
```

### Result Display:
```
🤖 Auto-Detection Result  [HIGH CONFIDENCE]

✅ 3/3 variables (100%) are normally distributed 
(Shapiro-Wilk test, p > 0.05). Your data appears normal.

## 📊 Test Data

### Create Test Files:

#### normal-data.csv (Should detect as normal):
```csv
age,height,weight
25,170,65
30,175,70
28,172,68
32,178,75
27,171,67
29,174,72
```

#### non-normal-data.csv (Should detect as NOT normal):
```csv
age,height,weight
25,170,65
30,175,70
28,172,68
100,250,200
27,171,67
29,174,72
```

#### paired-data.csv (Should detect as paired):
```csv
subject_id,time,score
1,pre,50
1,post,75
2,pre,55
2,post,80
3,pre,60
3,post,85
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Normal Data:
```
🤖 Auto-Detection Result [HIGH CONFIDENCE]

✅ 3/3 variables (100%) are normally distributed 
(Shapiro-Wilk test, p > 0.05). Your data appears normal.

Answer auto-filled: Yes ✓
```

### Non-Normal Data:
```
🤖 Auto-Detection Result [HIGH CONFIDENCE]

❌ Only 0/3 variables (0%) are normally distributed. 
Consider non-parametric tests.

Answer auto-filled: No ✓
```

### Paired Data:
```
🤖 Auto-Detection Result [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]

⚠️ Detected ID and time/repeated columns - data 
appears to be paired or repeated measures

Answer auto-filled: Paired ✓
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Please upload your data file first!"
**Solution:** Upload a file in Step 1 before clicking auto-detect

### Issue: Button is grayed out
**Solution:** File must be uploaded first (button disabled without file)

### Issue: Error message appears
**Check:**
- Worker is running on port 8001
- Backend is running on port 3001
- File is valid CSV/Excel format
- File has appropriate columns

### Issue: Result doesn't show
**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for API response
- Backend logs for errors

## 🎨 UI Features

### Confidence Badges:
- **HIGH** - Green badge, green background
- **MEDIUM** - Yellow badge, yellow background
- **LOW** - Red badge, red background

### Loading States:
- Spinning hourglass emoji
- "Analyzing your data..." text
- Button disabled during loading

### Animations:
- Fade-in animation for results
- Smooth transitions
- Hover effects on buttons

### Accessibility:
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Clear focus states

- % of users who click "I'm not sure"
- % of auto-detected answers kept vs changed
- Average time saved per wizard session

// Technical metrics
- API response time for auto-detection
- Error rate
- Confidence distribution (high/medium/low)

// User satisfaction
- Completion rate increase
- Support ticket reduction
- User feedback/ratings
```

## 💡 User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Way):
```
User: Opens Test Advisor
User: "Is my data normal?"
User: "I don't know... 😰"
User: Googles "how to test normality"
User: Spends 30 minutes confused
User: Guesses wrong
User: Gets wrong test recommendation
```

### After (New Way):
```
User: Opens Test Advisor
User: Uploads data file
User: "Is my data normal?"
User: Clicks "I'm not sure - Test it for me"
GradStat: Runs Shapiro-Wilk test
GradStat: "✅ Yes! High confidence"
User: "Wow, that was easy! 😊"
User: Gets correct test recommendation
```
